# raindrop.io

Collect and organize all of my bookmarks and sync across devices using folders and tags. I've traditionally used various browser bookmark managers, which has led to a rat's nest of saved information.

## Notes 
- It can be integrated into my current workflow through Obsidian
- raindrop.io is more than a bookmark manager
