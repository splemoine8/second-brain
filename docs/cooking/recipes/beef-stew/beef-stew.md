- 4 packets powdered gelatin

## Recipe

1. Preheat the oven to 500 F.
2. Remove band of fat in the center of the pieces of chuck. Cut the rest of the meat into cubes. You should be left with about 3.5lb/1.5kg of meat. 
3. Add meat cubes to a bowl and drizzle with generous amount of olive oil and 2 large pinches of salt. Toss to coat and spread beef onto a half sheet tray and load into oven to sear for about 20-25mins until well browned. 
4. Preheat a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium high. Add a generous glug of olive oil followed by mushrooms, carrots, onions, and pinch of salt. Sweat the veg to par-cook for 3-5mins until beginning to soften and caramelize. Transfer veg into a bowl and set aside. 
5. Return pan to stove over medium heat and add stick/115g butter. When butter is melted, add 100g or 3/4c of flour. Stir to cook, scraping up brown bits from bottom of the pot. Fry for 60-90 seconds until smooth and taking on color. Add beef stock and beer. Bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping frequently. 
6. When simmering, add in beef. Add a splash of water to the beef cooking tray, scraping up beef fond. Add to pot with beef. Stir to combine. 
7. Load pot, uncovered, into 300F/150C oven and cook for 2 hours, stirring halfway through.
8. Add potatoes into the bowl with the par-cooked vegetables and mix with 25g/3Tbsp flour. Toss to combine. (NOTE: if your stew is relatively thick at this point, omit tossing the veg in the flour or add less flour here). Add potatoes/veggies into stew pot and gently stir. Add in bay and thyme. Return to oven to cook for 1 more hour. 
9. At this point, check the beef and potato for done-ness. Beef should be tender and shreddable, but not shredded. Potato should be fork tender, but not mushy. Ladle off excess fat from top of stew (or allow to cool slightly, refrigerate, then scrape off fat from top once cooled). Stir peas into hot stew. 
10. Taste for seasoning and add salt if needed. Ladle into bowl, top with fresh cracked black pepper, and serve with a piece of rustic sourdough bread.
