## Notes
- While some believe that NAS systems should be built as standalone hardware, many are integrating them into their [home server.](home-server)

## Components
### Operating System
- [Promox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/): a hypervisor that I don't know too much about, but I know it is powerful.
- [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com): *More info to come*
- [OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org): *More info to come*
